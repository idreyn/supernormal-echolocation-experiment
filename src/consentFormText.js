            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is an experiment to learn more about how humans can decode spatial
                    information embedded in certain kinds of echoes. You will receive no direct
                    benefit from the results of this study, but they may be useful in researching
                    assistive technologies for blind people.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The researchers cannot and will not collect any personally identifiable
                    information from you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This study will take about 20 minutes to complete and you will be paid $5 USD
                    ($15/hour) when you complete it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As in all research activity, this experiment poses minor risk or discomfort to
                    participants, including boredom, fatigue, and discomfort from improperly
                    configured headphones. See below for more details.
                </li>
                <li>You may terminate your participation in the study at any time</li>

            <h2>Key study information</h2>
            <p>
                You are being asked to decide whether or not to participate in a research study. You
                are eligible to participate because you have identified yourself as an adult with
                normal or corrected vision and with normal hearing. This section is to give you key
                information to help you decide. More detailed information is given in the main
                consent that follows this section.
            </p>

            <h2>Study purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this research study is to study how information encoded in several
                kinds of modified echoes is understood by humans. Through the study we hope to
                understand more in general about what kinds of modifications are useful in signaling
                the location or other properties of sound-reflecting objects. This will help improve
                fundamental understanding of human hearing and aid the design of artificial
                sonar-based assistive devices.

            <h2>Duration and procedures</h2>
            <p>
                A typical session takes approximately 20 minutes. If you decide to participate, you
                may be invited to return for additional sessions depending on the study. You are
                never obligated to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will use a desktop or laptop computer with a mouse and keyboard to answer
                prompts related to echo sounds presented by the experiment software. Because these
                sounds have distinct left and right channel components, you must wear stereo
                headphones for the duration of the experiment.

            <h2>Risks or Discomforts</h2>
            <p>
                The possible risks, discomforts, and/or side effects related to participation in
                this study are very small. They include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Discomfort related to echo presentations:</b> To avoid the discomfort of loud
                    or unpleasant echo sounds, a procedure at the beginning of the experiment will
                    help you calibrate your computer volume. You are also free to terminate your
                    participation at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Boredom or Fatigue:</b> Tasks may cause you to experience boredom,
                    sleepiness, or minor headaches. You will be able to take breaks as needed and
                    the software will encourage you to do so at regular intervals. You are also free
                    to terminate your participation at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Breach of confidentiality:</b> As with all research, and as stated below in
                    the “Confidentiality” section, there is a chance that confidentiality could be
                    compromised; however, we are taking precautions to minimize this risk, and we do
                    not collect your personal information in this study.

                You will not directly benefit from this research study, but you may derive interest
                from learning about research into perception and mobility. In the longer term, the
                knowledge gained may be of value to humanity.

                You are free to decline participation in this study. There is no alternative
                treatment or therapy that would be an equivalent to participation.
